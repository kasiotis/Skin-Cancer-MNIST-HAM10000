Welcome to my project !! 

In the same directory you can see the files where I have implemented all of my Python code
for the skin cancer classification project. To run these scripts you first need to set up
a few things.

1. You need to go to the `cancer-data` folder and follow the instructions for importing the data.
2. You need to set up a Python interpreter, in case you are using a virtual environment I have prepared a folder for you called `venv`.
3. Once you have set up your interpreter you need to install all of the libraries that I have used in this project. Unfortunately I could not submit my virtual environment with all my pre-installed libraries because the size was too big.
4. The jupyter notebooks with the literate programming for the detailed report, summary and abstract are found in the `b8035526-ml-notebooks` folder in both .ipynb and pdf formats.
